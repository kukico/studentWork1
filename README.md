FrontEnd 
The Folder contains all the code for the front end of the pages, the aesthetics, layers, buttons, input fields, etc.
It also contains lines of code to code the directory between the pages allowing us to go from one page to another.
It doesn not contain link to the Database and doesnt make anything functional. This is done by the other folders.
